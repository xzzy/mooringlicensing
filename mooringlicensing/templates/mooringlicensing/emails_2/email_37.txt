Please be advised that the licensee of mooring site {{ mooring.name }} has recently swapped their mooring site licence with another licensee in the same bay, as allowed under the Rottnest Island Regulations 1988.
This means that effective immediately all authorised users of {{ mooring.name }} have now been removed.
You are now notified to return authorised user sticker(s) {{ sticker.number }} to the Rottnest Island Authority.
Please access {{ dashboard_external_url }} if you wish to make an amendment application for an authorised user site to be endorsed by a mooring site licensee known to you.
If you are left without any authorised user sites, and you do not hold a mooring site license in your name, access {{ dashboard_external_url }} to make an amendment application for an authorised user site to be allocated by RIA.
